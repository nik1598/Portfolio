            <h1> Education </h1>
            <p>
                I graduated from Missouri State University in Fall 2019. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed dabbling with computers and experimenting with different applications. Because my own lifetime has essentially coincided with the rise of the modern computing industry, I can sense that there are still tremendous developments to come in this field. It was natural for me to choose Information Technology as my university major.
            </p>

            <h1> Work Experience </h1>
            <p>
                I have worked for American National, an Insurance Company as an IT Intern. I must admit that it gave me a lot of exposure towards the current technologies used, and the industrial standards. Having worked in a production environment for almost an year and having gained high-level knowledge of its importance and business, I feel that I am ready to move forward in the field of Information Technology focusing on Application Development.
